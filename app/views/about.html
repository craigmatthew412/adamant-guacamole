				Hi there, Reader!  I am Craig McMurray, an Application Developer from Pittsburgh.  Ambitious, passionate, and talented are only a few of my qualities and I have a combined 6+ years of professional experience in the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Retail industries. I am constantly seeking new ways to improve, and my skill sets are ever evolving.  My development portfolio contains projects ranging from Enterprise Java Applications to fully Responsive Websites and everything in-between.  My true interest and passion is Mobile Web, and I am currently employed at Dick’s Sporting Goods as the Lead Mobile Web Developer where I take great pride in my work.  I also freelance and have completed several projects that implement Mobile First, Progressive Enhancement, and Responsive Web Design patterns.  Feel free to view this work in the <a du-smooth-scroll="work" title="Freelance Portfolio">Freelance</a> section below.  If you are interested in collaborating with me, please reach out <a du-smooth-scroll="contactme" title="Contact Me">here</a>!  I am currently open to exciting projects and working with talented individuals.
