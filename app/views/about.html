				Hi there, Reader! I am Craig McMurray, a Full Stack Engineer from Pittsburgh. Ambitious, driven, passionate, and talented are only a few of my qualities. I have a combined 8 years of professional experience in the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Retail industries. My skills sets are ever evolving as I am constantly seeking new ways to improve and learn. I believe that self-improvement, both personal and professional, should be something that everyone aims for.
			</p>
			<p>
				My development portfolio contains projects ranging from Enterprise Java Web and Offline Batch Applications to Responsive Websites and almost everything in-between. My true interest and passion is Web Development, and I am currently employed at DICK'S Sporting Goods as the Lead Mobile Web Developer where I take great pride in my work. I strive to provide the highest quality of work, while also delivering tremendous value. I love working with others as passionate as I am, because I believe that is when truly amazing things can happen. I also find great value in teamwork.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my spare time, I also freelance and have completed several projects that implement Mobile First, Progressive Enhancement, and Responsive Web Design patterns.  Feel free to view this work in the <a du-smooth-scroll="work" title="Freelance Portfolio">Freelance</a> section below.
