					Hi there, Reader!  I am Craig McMurray, an Application Developer from Pittsburgh.  Ambitious, passionate, and talented are only a few of my qualities and I have a combined 6+ years of professional experience in the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Retail industries. I am constantly seeking new ways to improve, and my skill sets are ever evolving.  My development portfolio contains projects ranging from Enterprise Java Applications to fully Responsive Websites and everything in-between.  My true interest and passion is Mobile Web, and I am currently employed at Dick’s Sporting Goods as the Lead Mobile Web Developer where I take great pride in my work.  I also freelance and have completed several projects that implement Mobile First, Progressive Enhancement, Responsive Web Design (RWD), and User Experience (UX) design patterns.  Feel free to view my freelance work in the <a data-scroll href="#work" title="My Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section below.  If you are interested in collaborating with me, please reach out <a data-scroll href="#contactme" title="Contact Me">here</a>!  I am currently open to exciting projects and working with talented individuals.
